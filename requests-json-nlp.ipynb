Almost Honest is the closest to nuetral of the three but the other two are downright angry. I think the sentiment analysis is thrown off by sarcasm in the way Manson describes a veneer of beauty covering violent facists. I am unsure what is throwing off the analysis in the FFDP song, though, as it is pretty straightforward. My only guess is that the analysis uses scoring on individual words instead of assessing a whole phrase."
